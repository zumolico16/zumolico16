## Hi there 👋
My name is Miguel Manso, I'm 31 years old and recently finished my bachelor's degree in computer science in Instituto Politécnico de Portalegre. My final project of the bachelor's was about anomaly detection in pressure sensors of the campus irrigation system. It was a comparative study of unsupervised machine learning algorithms vs. statistical process control (Shewhart control charts).

🔭 I'm currently looking for a job in the field o ML/AI
⚾ I'm currently working on a personal project, trying to predict the outcome of baseball matches
🌱 I'm currently learning about LLMs
